Customer Churn Prediction using Logistic Regression

Caption

This project demonstrates the process of building a customer churn prediction model using Logistic Regression. It covers data loading, preprocessing, model training, prediction, feature importance analysis, and model evaluation using log loss.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to churn (cancel their service or subscription). By accurately predicting churn, businesses can proactively engage with at-risk customers, implement retention strategies, and ultimately reduce customer attrition, leading to improved customer lifetime value and business profitability.
